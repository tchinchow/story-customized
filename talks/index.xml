before you present. This is a dummy page illustrating this capability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll have to add &lt;code>buildFuture: true&lt;/code> to your site&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>config.yaml&lt;/code> to enable
this setting. Talks pages that are in the future won&amp;rsquo;t appear on the homepage
or in your RSS feeds; they&amp;rsquo;ll only appear in the &lt;code>/talks/&lt;/code> list page of your
site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This page also illustrates that you can use PDF slides. Story uses PDF.js to embed a slide viewer.
So you don&amp;rsquo;t have to build slides in RemarkJS, you can host them yourself, like Slideshare (but better).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creating Beautiful Presentations with Story</title><link>https://story-customized.tchinchow.net/talks/adirondack/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 May 2018 16:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://story-customized.tchinchow.net/talks/adirondack/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a &amp;ldquo;talk&amp;rdquo; page in Story, which is the permanent homepage for a talk
you&amp;rsquo;ve given at a specific event. It&amp;rsquo;s designed to showcase your appearance by
bringing together information about the event, along with your slides and extra
information like a video of your talk. In this way you can build a portfolio of
your speaking history.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
