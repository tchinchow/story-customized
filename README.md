# Story

Story is a beautiful [Hugo theme](https://gohugo.io) for showcasing your writing
and presentations. You can see Story in use on a real site by its creator:
[Baron Schwartz](https://www.xaprb.com/).

Story-Customized is an augmented version of the original Story theme. Just like
with Story, there's a robust [demo site](https://story-customized.tchinchow.net/)
where you can see its many features in action, and learn more about how to use them.

Story is targeted to technical writers and
speakers: people such as software engineers and open source developers, who want a
website for their technical work, such as blogging about software
engineering. It's a great way to share your writing and speaking with the world.

It has a lot of features for people who invest effort in their websites and blogs!

- Beautiful, responsive typography for long-form content on screen and in print, including blogs, essays, and single pages.
- Support for [RemarkJS slides](https://remarkjs.com/).
- LaTeX math typesetting with [KaTeX](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX)
- A built-in search page with [LunrJS](https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js).
- Music notation typesetting with [abcjs](https://abcjs.net/).
- Easy-to-use, backwards-compatible Markdown enhancements such as ways to control image behavior (size, float, etc) with CSS.

Story-Customized now adds a handful of new features !

- Slideshows with [FlexSlider2](http://flexslider.woothemes.com/).
- [MermaidJS](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) diagrams.
- Maps with [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

Don't take my word for it. Browse through the [demo site](https://story-customized.tchinchow.net/)
